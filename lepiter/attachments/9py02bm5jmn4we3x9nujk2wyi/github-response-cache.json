This problem would, if I understand it correctly, be resolved if the Zettelkasten development changes to trunk based development, but it could still be useful in the meantime.\r\n\r\nAlso, speaking as a untalented autodidact I am, it would be great, if we could try to mark problems that are suitable for newcommers and people with limited skills like me. Of course I understand that there is a thin line here: I try to contribute with my limited skills but am aware that others are not responsible for helping me and that this should not end up being more work for them than doing things themselves. But the feenk example assumes a relatively fixed team of professionals and perhaps it could be good to create some inclusive opportunities beyond that in the Zettelkasten project?\r\n\r\nSo, I hope my story is somewhat convincing. ;)\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @trutzig89182 in https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Team/Zettelkasten/issues/375#issuecomment-961904063_","reactions":{"heart":0,"+1":1,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Zettelkasten-Team/Zettelkasten/issues/390/reactions","-1":0,"eyes":0,"confused":0,"rocket":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"total_count":1},"locked":false,"state":"open","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Zettelkasten-Team/Zettelkasten/issues/390","id":1045874193,"milestone":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Team/Zettelkasten/issues/390","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Zettelkasten-Team/Zettelkasten","active_lock_reason":null,"events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Zettelkasten-Team/Zettelkasten/issues/390/events","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
